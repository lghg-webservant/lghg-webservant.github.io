Hey all, I just wanted to say a huge thank you for hosting this group. I'm now near on four days clean from Heroin etc and I'm not sure that I would have gotten even this far if I hadn't stumbled upon your group a couple days ago.  I'm all the way out in London, England, so to hear stories that I can relate to from all the way across the other side of the globe is superb! Here's to another day clean , thank you all, each and everyone of you
